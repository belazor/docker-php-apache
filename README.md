# PHP-Apache

PHP 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5 [reached EOL](http://php.net/eol.php) a good while ago and thus, official docker support was [dropped](https://github.com/docker-library/php/pull/20). If you need to test legacy applications, these images might help.

# What is PHP?

PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development, but which can also be used as a general-purpose programming language. PHP can be added to straight HTML or it can be used with a variety of templating engines and web frameworks. PHP code is usually processed by an interpreter, which is either implemented as a native module on the web-server or as a common gateway interface (CGI).
